Predictive Modeling Using Linear Regression
The Predictive Modeling Using Linear Regression project focuses on developing a machine learning model to forecast numerical outcomes based on one or more input features. By leveraging a dataset with a continuous target variable, the project follows a structured approach, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature selection. Understanding the relationship between independent and dependent variables is key, and techniques such as correlation analysis and scatter plots were used to visualize these connections. Handling missing values, scaling numerical data, and encoding categorical variables ensured that the dataset was well-prepared for model training.

The Linear Regression model was then built and fine-tuned to achieve optimal predictive performance. Techniques such as train-test splitting, cross-validation, and performance evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared were used to assess the model's accuracy and generalizability. Additionally, the project explored assumptions of linear regression, such as linearity, independence, and homoscedasticity, to ensure the model's reliability. The insights gained from this study highlight the power of linear regression in making data-driven predictions, demonstrating its real-world applications in domains like finance, real estate, and business analytics.
